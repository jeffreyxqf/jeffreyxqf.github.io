尼尔森十大原则 

-  Visibility of system status

   The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.




   
-  Match between system and the real world

    The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

- User control and freedom

  Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

- Consistency and standards

  Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions
  
- Error prevention


  Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
  
- Recognition rather than recall

  Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
  
- Flexibility and efficiency of use

  Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
  
- Aesthetic and minimalist design

  Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
  
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

  Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
  
- Help and documentation

  Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large


- 一、状态可见原则 
用户在网页上的任何操作，不论是单击、滚动还是按下键盘，页面应即时给出反馈。“即时”是指，页面响应时间小于用户能忍受的等待时间。  
- 二、环境贴切原则 
网页的一切表现和表述，应该尽可能贴近用户所在的环境（年龄、学历、文化、时代背景），而不要使用第二世界的语言。《iPhone人机交互指南》里提到的隐喻与拟物化是很好的实践。此外，还应该使用易懂和约定俗成的表达。  
- 三、撤销重做原则  
为了避免用户的误用和误击，网页应提供撤销和重做功能。  
- 四、一致性原则  
同一用语、功能、操作保持一致。 
- 五、防错原则  
通过网页的设计、重组或特别安排，防止用户出错。  
- 六、易取原则  
好记性不如烂笔头。尽可能减少用户回忆负担，把需要记忆的内容摆上台面。  
- 七、灵活高效原则  
中级用户的数量远高于初级和高级用户数。为大多数用户设计，不要低估，也不可轻视，保持灵活高效。  
- 八、易扫原则  
互联网用户浏览网页的动作不是读，不是看，而是扫。易扫，意味着突出重点，弱化和剔除无关信息。  
- 九、容错原则  
帮助用户从错误中恢复，将损失降到最低。如果无法自动挽回，则提供详尽的说明文字和指导方向，而非代码，比如404。 
- 十、人性化帮助原则  
帮助性提示最好的方式是：1、无需提示；2、一次性提示；3、常驻提示；4；帮助文档。
